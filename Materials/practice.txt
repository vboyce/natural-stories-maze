The main trees in coniferous forests are evergreen conifers such as firs, spruces, and pines.
These forests are found in Canada, Northern Europe, and Northern Asia where the winter weather is cold.
In spring, the snow melts, and some parts of the forest become swampy.
Fallen branches, needles, and dead animals decay slowly, so the soil is not very fertile.
Only trees adapted to the cold and the poor soil can survive.
Conifers shade the ground thoroughly, which means few plants grow on the forest floor.
Some animals that live in coniferous forests include deer, bears, moose, and owls. 


What happens in the spring? {parts of the forest get swampy, many plants start growing on the forest floor}
Why is the soil not very fertile? {plants and animals decompose slowly, the trees use up all the nutrients}
